An online tic tac toe app created in <a href='http://www.reactjs.org'>React</a>. Peer-to-peer interactions are handled with <a href='http://www.peerjs.com'>Peer JS.</a><br>
Players can play the lite three version of tic tac toe in a 3x3 grid which guarantees that a draw outcome is impossible.
## Nice todos
- Use names instead of long IDs regenerated every time by Peer JS
- Make the board arbitrarily large
- anything else you think would be cool...
